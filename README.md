# sbox-vr-minimal

**Note:** This is currently a work-in-progress rewrite of the template. I recommend against using this until it's finished.

Basic minimal setup for VR in s&box.

## Features

- Basic locomotion
- Snap turning
- Basic hands

## Known Issues

- Locomotion does not track HMD movement, only playspace center
- Hands have no animation - they are just a static model

## Using the template

1. `git clone https://github.com/xezno/sbox-vr-minimal` in your s&box addons folder
2. Launch s&box with the `-vr` launch argument
3. Add the .addon file using the s&box addon manager
